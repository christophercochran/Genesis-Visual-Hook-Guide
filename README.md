# Genesis Visual Hook Guide
![Find that hook you need!](assets/banner-772x250.png)

Find Genesis hooks (action and filter hooks) quick and easily by seeing their actual locations inside your theme.

## Description 

Once a tool for myself the Genesis Visual Hook guide has slowly evolved into what it is today. I finally welcome the plugin version of the popular [Visual Genesis Hooks and Filters Guide](http://genesistutorials.com/visual-hook-guide) from [Genesis Tutorials](http://genesistutorials.com).

Once installed this plugin adds a drop down menu to the admin bar to select between three views (Hook, Filter, and Markup). Select an option or all three to see the hooks in their actual locations on your current theme.

Great companion to [Genesis Simple Hooks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-simple-hooks/).

**Genesis Theme Framework required.**

## FAQ
### I have my admin bar disable, can I still view the hooks without it?

Sure! The views are triggered by a query string. Simply add ?g_markup=show ?g_hooks=show or ?g_filters=show to the end the url.
