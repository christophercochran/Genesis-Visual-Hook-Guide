# Genesis Visual Hook Guide

Find Genesis hooks (action and filter hooks) quick and easily by seeing their actual locations inside your theme.

## Description

The plugin version of the popular [Visual Genesis Hooks and Filters Guide](http://genesistutorials.com/visual-hook-guide) from [Genesis Tutorials](http://genesistutorials.com).

Once installed this plugin adds a drop down menu to the admin bar to select between three views (Hook, Filter, and Markup). Select an option or all three to see the hooks in their actual locations on your current theme.

Great companion to [Genesis Simple Hooks](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-simple-hooks/).

**Genesis Theme Framework required.**
